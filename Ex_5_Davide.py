# Exercise 4: Implementing a Simple Graph Transformer with LapPE and RWSE

# Task 1: Implement Laplacian Positional Encodings (LapPE)
# - Compute Laplacian eigenvectors using the graph Laplacian matrix `L = D - A`.
# - Use `eigh` for efficient eigendecomposition (optimized for Hermitian matrices).
# - Handle sign ambiguity in eigenvectors (random flipping or SignNet).
# - Ensure embeddings are robust to sign flips and can capture graph structure.

# Task 2: Combine LapPE with SignNet
# - Implement SignNet to process Laplacian eigenvectors.
# - SignNet should make the network invariant to eigenvector sign flips.
# - Test how SignNet affects the quality of embeddings in downstream tasks.

# Task 3: Implement Random Walk Structural Embeddings (RWSE)
# - Compute RWSE by counting closed walks of a given length `k`:
#   - Use the trace of powers of the adjacency matrix: `tr(A^2)`, `tr(A^3)`, ..., `tr(A^k)`.
#   - Concatenate these trace values for embeddings.
# - Ensure efficient computation for larger graphs.
# - Compare RWSE with LapPE in terms of performance and computational cost.

# Task 4: Implement a Pure Graph Transformer
# - Treat nodes as tokens and apply a standard transformer model.
# - Use global attention to aggregate information across all nodes.
# - Start with node labels as initial embeddings and incorporate LapPE and RWSE.
# - Implement and test the transformer to evaluate its ability to capture graph structure.

# Task 5: Test the Performance of LapPE and RWSE Embeddings
# - Test LapPE and RWSE embeddings with:
#   - A Graph Neural Network (GNN) model.
#   - The pure Graph Transformer implemented above.
# - Compare results to understand how the embeddings impact performance.

# Task 6: Test on Datasets
# - Use the following datasets for training and evaluation:
#   1. **Peptides-func**:
#      - Apply an atom-encoder to represent nodes (atoms in molecules).
#      - Combine the atom-encoder embeddings with LapPE and RWSE.
#   2. **Cora**:
#      - Test embeddings and transformer performance on this graph dataset.

# Expected Outputs:
# - Implementations for LapPE, SignNet, RWSE, and Graph Transformer.
# - Performance results of GNN and Transformer models using LapPE and RWSE embeddings.
# - Observations and insights on dataset-specific challenges and results.

# Notes:
# - Ensure efficiency for matrix operations (e.g., sparse operations for large graphs).
# - Document any challenges encountered and how they were addressed.
# - Use modular code to make experiments reproducible and flexible for different datasets.

# Bonus: Try hybrid models that combine GNN-style message passing with transformer blocks
# and compare their performance with pure transformers.
